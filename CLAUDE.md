# The Data App

Personal fitness tracker (workouts, runs, PRs, analytics). React 19 + TypeScript + Vite,
Firebase Realtime DB, Recharts, deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
on every push to `main`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server
- `npm run build` — typecheck (`tsc -b`) + production build. Run this before considering work done.
- `npm run lint` — eslint

## UI patterns

**Typography scale** — defined in `src/styles/typography.ts`; always import from there
instead of hand-rolling font styles. The hierarchy every page follows:

| Role | Style | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Page title | Outfit 24px/700 | the single `h2` at the top of a page |
| Section title | Outfit 18px/600 | `h3` separating sections |
| Card title | Outfit 16px/600 | Card / history-item titles, paired with a 16px icon |
| Body text | Inter 14px, `--text-secondary` | metric & info rows |
| Meta text | Inter 13px, `--text-muted` | dates, fine print |
| Stat value | Inter 32px/bold | big numbers in stat cards |

Card layout pattern for history items (see Run + Workout cards): small inline icon (16px) +
title + chips on one row, date on the right, then one compact metrics row underneath.
Form styles live in `src/styles/formStyles.ts`.

**Dates: simpler is better.** Never show verbose dates ("Wednesday, Jun 10th 2026 - 4:57 PM").
- History items: `d MMM, HH:mm` → "10 Jun, 16:57", muted, on the right
- Records / low-precision: `MM/yy` → "04/26"
- Weekly chart axes: week start only via `weekAxisTick` ("Jan 6"); tooltips get the compact
  range from `getWeekLabel` ("Jan 6 – 12"). Use `minTickGap` so axes never get crowded.

**Charts**: every chart `Card` is exactly **360px tall** — side-by-side graphs must always
match heights, otherwise the page looks sloppy. Chart headers use the shared
`.dmc-header` / `.dmc-pills` classes from `src/components/analytics/ChartPills.css`
(they wrap on narrow screens instead of overflowing the card).

**Mobile matters.** This app is used on a phone. Nothing may bleed out of its container:
grid cells need `min-width: 0`, native date/time inputs are width-capped in `App.css`,
pill rows wrap. Check layouts at ~375px width when touching UI.

## Data conventions

- Weights are stored in **kg**; convert for display with `unit === 'lbs' ? 2.20462 : 1`
  from `useSettings()`.
- Workout history is flat sets grouped into sessions via `groupWorkoutSessions`.
- Exercise → muscle-group mapping comes from the DB (`useExercises().getMuscleGroup`),
  never hardcoded.

## Versioning

The version is **derived from git at build time** in `vite.config.ts` (injected as
`__APP_VERSION__`, declared in `src/vite-env.d.ts`) — do not edit it by hand and ignore
`package.json`'s version field. Scheme: commit 504ba75 (rename to "The Data App") is the
v2.0.0 baseline; each commit bumps the patch and every 10 commits roll into the minor
(`2.{n/10}.{n%10}`). It updates automatically on every push because the Pages workflow
rebuilds (checkout uses `fetch-depth: 0` — keep it, the commit count needs full history).
The version is shown on the loading screen (`App.tsx`) and the Settings footer.
